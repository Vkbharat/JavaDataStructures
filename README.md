# JavaDataStructures
Java based Data Structure Implementation

1.Single linked list -Create node,update Node,Delete Node,list length,traversal
2.Double linked list -Create node,update Node,Delete Node,list length,traversal(First to last and last to first)

Sorting Techniques
1.Bubble sort (without temp variable swapping)
2.Selection sort (swapping using xor operator)

Duplicates removal from single linked list with and without Buffer
